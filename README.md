# skateboard vision frontend

This is the web application code to contribute to the skateboard vision project. 

Originally this was a directory and build step of [the skateboard vision project](https://github.com/kevinwylder/sbvision), but now it has a separate repo.

### production environment

`yarn build` runs a production webpack build, and points the api at https://sbvision.kwylder.com

### dev environment

`yarn dev` starts webpack in watch mode, and builds the API package pointed to `localhost:1080`.
